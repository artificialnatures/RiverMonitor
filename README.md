# River Monitor

Software supporting an artwork by [Aaron Marx](http://aaronmarx.com/) at the Minneapolis Public Service Building, 505 Fourth Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55415

The artwork occupies the ceiling of an elevator lobby. It is constructed from wood slats, profiled to represent the topography of the Mississippi River as it flows through downtown Minneapolis. The slats are backlit with an array of LED lights which are animated using a [Color Kinetics](https://www.colorkinetics.com/) controller. The lighting animations are triggered, in real time, by the conditions of the Mississippi River at the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam.
